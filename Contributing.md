## Development Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream** before starting any new work:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** for your changes (branch off `main`):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. Make your changes, then **test locally** before pushing:

   ```bash
   npm run dev       # Run dev server
   npm run build     # Ensure production build passes
   npm run lint      # Check for linting errors
   ```

4. **Commit and push** your branch:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Open a **Pull Request** on GitHub.

## Making a Contribution

### Find an Issue

- Browse [open issues](../../issues) and look for ones labelled `good first issue` or `GSSoC`.
- **Comment on the issue** to get it assigned to you before starting work.
- Do not submit a PR for an issue that isn't assigned to you.

### Working on UI Components

WEBIFY uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components located in `components/ui/`. When contributing new components:

- Follow the existing component patterns in that directory.
- Add components via the shadcn CLI where possible:
  ```bash
  npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>
  ```
- Keep components generic and reusable.

### Working on Pages / Features

- New pages go inside the `app/` directory following Next.js App Router conventions.
- Page-specific components belong in `app/components/`.
- Shared/reusable logic goes in `lib/`.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>: <short description>
```

| Type       | Use for                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | A new feature                              |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                  |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                 |
| `style`    | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.       |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                   |

**Examples:**

```
feat: add dark mode toggle to navbar
fix: resolve button alignment on mobile
docs: update README with deployment steps
```

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One PR per issue.** Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- Fill out the **PR template** completely (description, screenshots if UI changes, related issue number).
- Link the issue in your PR description using `Closes #<issue-number>`.
- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main` before opening a PR.
- PRs must pass all checks (lint, build) before review.
- Be responsive to review comments — address feedback promptly.
- Do **not** force-push to a PR branch after review has started.

---

## Style Guide

- **Language:** TypeScript is used throughout. Avoid `any` types where possible.
- **Styling:** Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility classes. Avoid writing custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- **Components:** Follow existing patterns in `components/ui/`. Use `shadcn/ui` conventions.
- **Formatting:** The project uses ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`) and Prettier. Run `npm run lint` before committing.
- **Imports:** Use absolute imports where configured. Keep imports organized (external → internal → relative).

---

## Need Help?

- Check existing [issues](../../issues) and [pull requests](../../pulls) first.
- If you're stuck, comment on the relevant issue and ask for guidance.
- For GSSoC-specific queries, refer to the [GSSoC official documentation](https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/).

We're excited to have you on board. Happy contributing! 🚀
